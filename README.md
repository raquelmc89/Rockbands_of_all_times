# Rockbands_of_all_times


I am learning HTM5L, CSS3 and JavaScript to become a front end developer. This quiz is my second project to demostrate what I have learned to this moment.

## Description

This is a simple quiz about classic Rock bands. it consists in 10 questions, score which increment by 10 if the answer in correct, and a question counter.
at the end of the game you can restart the game if you wish and create an user name. 
to create this quiz I have used HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. 

It was my first project using JavaScript so I had to look for a lot of help, some good resources ive been using are:

* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) : great page to learn javascript algorithms and data structures.

* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com): to learn from very basic to more complicated coding.

* [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com): good forum.

* [Just answer](https://www.justanswer.co.uk): one-on-one help.

* [JESON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON): to learn all about JSON.
